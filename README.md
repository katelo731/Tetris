### rules :

The next block would randomly appear and print in the hint zone，

there are 7 kinds of blocks，each of them would appears with 4 random rotation forms.


You need to let the blocks "disappear"--simply by letting the entire row filled with blocks.

As you clear more rows in the same time，more scores you get in one operation.

Once the block stack to the top of the ceil，the game is over!

### control : using keyboard

↑ : rotate

↓ : move downward

← : move to left-hand side

→ : move to right-hand side


space : freeze

re-space : continue


esc : escape
